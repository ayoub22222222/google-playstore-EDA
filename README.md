## EDA and Feature Engineering fr google app store

![Data Model]()


This is an end-to-end data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering project,
which includes the process of cleaning the dataset using the pandas library and visualizing data distribution using matplotlib to detect outliers.
Additionally, this project includes reusable code to automate the processes of loading, cleaning, and saving the data file.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

furthermore this projct will answer the following quetions:

## 🗂️ Data Structure Overview

This project is based on a dataset from Kaggle representing the Google Play Store.
We will not provide an in-depth explanation of every single column and its data type.
Instead, we will focus on cleaning and converting each column into its proper data type.
